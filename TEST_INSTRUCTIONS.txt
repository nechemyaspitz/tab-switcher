TEST INSTRUCTIONS FOR CHROME WEB STORE REVIEWERS
=================================================

OVERVIEW

Tab Switcher is a browser extension that works with a companion macOS app to provide visual, MRU-ordered tab switching via Ctrl+Tab. The extension alone cannot intercept Ctrl+Tab (browser limitation), so the native app handles keyboard interception and communicates with the extension via Chrome's Native Messaging API.


REQUIREMENTS

- macOS (the companion app is macOS-only)
- Chrome (or any Chromium-based browser)
- Accessibility permission (required for the app to intercept Ctrl+Tab)


STEP-BY-STEP TESTING GUIDE

1. Download the Companion App

   Download the macOS app from: https://tabswitcher.app/setup
   
   Or direct DMG link: https://tabswitcher.app/Tab%20Switcher.dmg
   
   The app is signed and notarized by Apple (Developer ID: Nechemia Spitz).

2. Install the App

   - Open the downloaded DMG
   - Drag "Tab Switcher" to the Applications folder
   - Open "Tab Switcher" from Applications
   - Grant Accessibility permission when prompted (required to intercept Ctrl+Tab)
   - If not prompted, go to: System Settings > Privacy & Security > Accessibility > Enable "Tab Switcher"

3. Configure the Extension

   When the Tab Switcher app opens, you'll see a setup window:
   
   - Find "Google Chrome" in the list and click "Enable"
   - You'll be asked to enter the Extension ID
   - To get the Extension ID:
     * Go to chrome://extensions in Chrome
     * Enable "Developer mode" (toggle in top-right)
     * Find "Tab Switcher" and copy the ID (32-character string)
   - Paste the ID into the Tab Switcher app and click "Save"
   - Click "Done"

4. Test the Extension

   - Open Chrome with multiple tabs (at least 3-4 tabs)
   - Visit different tabs to build up a "most recently used" order
   - Hold Ctrl and press Tab:
     * A visual switcher should appear showing tab thumbnails
     * Keep holding Ctrl and press Tab again to cycle through tabs
     * Release Ctrl to switch to the selected tab
   - Test Ctrl+Shift+Tab to cycle backwards
   - Test quick switch: Press Ctrl+Tab and release quickly — should jump to your previous tab

5. Verify Extension Popup

   - Click the Tab Switcher extension icon in Chrome's toolbar
   - You should see a status popup showing "Connected" (green) if everything is working


EXPECTED BEHAVIOR

- Ctrl+Tab (hold): Visual switcher appears with tab thumbnails
- Ctrl+Tab (tap quickly): Instant switch to previous tab
- Ctrl+Shift+Tab: Cycle backwards through tabs
- Release Ctrl: Switch to highlighted tab, close switcher
- Extension icon click: Shows connection status popup


TROUBLESHOOTING

"Not Connected" in popup:
- Ensure Tab Switcher app is running
- Verify the Extension ID was entered correctly in the app
- Try quitting and reopening Chrome

Ctrl+Tab does nothing:
- Check that Tab Switcher has Accessibility permission
- Ensure the app is running (check Activity Monitor for "tab-switcher")

Permission prompt doesn't appear:
- Manually enable in: System Settings > Privacy & Security > Accessibility
