## Detailed Description

```
Tab Switcher reimagines Ctrl+Tab for your browser. Instead of cycling through tabs left-to-right, switch between them the way you switch between apps on macOS — with visual previews and most-recently-used ordering.

HOW IT WORKS
Hold Ctrl and press Tab to bring up a visual switcher showing thumbnails of all your tabs. Keep holding Ctrl and press Tab to cycle through them. Release Ctrl to switch. It's the same muscle memory as Cmd+Tab on macOS, but for your browser tabs.

KEY FEATURES

• Visual Tab Previews
See live thumbnails, favicons, and titles as you cycle. No more guessing which tab is which.

• Most Recently Used Order
Tabs are ordered by when you last used them, not their position in the tab bar. A single Ctrl+Tab instantly jumps to your previous tab.

• Native Performance
A lightweight macOS companion app intercepts the keyboard shortcut at the system level, so it responds instantly every time.

• Multi-Browser Support
Works with Chrome, Brave, Edge, Arc, Vivaldi, Opera, and any Chromium-based browser.

REQUIREMENTS
This extension requires a free companion macOS app to intercept the Ctrl+Tab shortcut (browsers don't allow extensions to override this key combination).

KEYBOARD SHORTCUTS
• Ctrl+Tab — Open switcher, cycle forward through recent tabs
• Ctrl+Shift+Tab — Cycle backward
• Alt+W — Quick switch to last tab (no UI)

PRIVACY
Tab Switcher operates entirely on your device. No data is collected, stored, or transmitted to any server. Your browsing activity stays private.
